I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science and Graduate Research Associate at The Ohio State University, working on problems in Natural Language Processing, Question-Answering and Dialogue Systems under the guidance of Prof. Huan Sun. My current research is focussed on reasoning and grounding in Large Language Models. I hold an MS in CS from GeogiaTech and have completed my Bachelors in CS from BITS Pilani, Goa. Prior to starting my PhD, I have worked for 8 years in the industry at various applied research positions including two years at Microsoft Bing.

Outside of work, I have a variety of interests. I enjoy going to the gym, running, and playing cricket and basketball. I also love hiking and exploring the great outdoors. Other interests include cars, anime, and PC gaming!
