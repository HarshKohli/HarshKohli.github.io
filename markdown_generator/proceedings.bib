abstract="Modern transformer-based neural architectures yield impressive results in nearly every NLP task and Word Sense Disambiguation, the problem of discerning the correct sense of a word in a given context, is no exception. State-of-the-art approaches in WSD today leverage lexical information along with pre-trained embeddings from these models to achieve results comparable to human inter-annotator agreement on standard evaluation benchmarks. In the same vein, we experiment with several strategies to optimize bi-encoders for this specific task and propose alternative methods of presenting lexical information to our model. Through our multi-stage pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline we further the state of the art in Word Sense Disambiguation.",

abstract="Many downstream NLP tasks have shown significant improvement through continual pre-training, transfer learning and multi-task learning. State-of-the-art approaches in Word Sense Disambiguation today benefit from some of these approaches in conjunction with information sources such as semantic relationships and gloss definitions contained within WordNet. Our work builds upon these systems and uses data augmentation along with extensive pre-training on various different NLP tasks and datasets. Our transfer learning and augmentation pipeline achieves state-of-the-art single model performance in WSD and is at par with the best ensemble results.",

abstract = {Related or ideal follow-up suggestions to a web query in search engines are often
optimized based on several different parameters -- relevance to the original query,
diversity, click probability etc. One or many rankers may be trained to score each
suggestion from a candidate pool based on these factors. These scorers are usually
pairwise classification tasks where each training example consists of a user query
and a single suggestion from the list of candidates. We propose an architecture that
takes all candidate suggestions associated with a given query and outputs a suggestion
block. We discuss the benefits of such an architecture over traditional approaches
and experiment with further enforcing each individual metric through mixed-objective
training.},

abstract = {Search queries issued over the Web increasingly look like questions, especially as
the domain becomes more specific. Finding good response to such queries amounts to
finding relevant passages from Web documents. Traditional information retrieval based
Web search still matches the query to the words in the entire document. With the advent
of machine reading comprehension techniques, Web search is moving more towards identifying
the best sentence / group of sentences in the document. We present AQuPR an A ttention
based Qu ery P assage R etrieval system to find human acceptable answer containing
passages to technology queries issued over the Web. We train character level embeddings
for the query and passage pairs, train a deep recurrent network with a novel simplified
attention mechanism and incorporate additional signals present in Web documents to
improve the performance of such a system. We collect a database of human issued queries
along with their answer passages and learn an end to end system to enable automated
query resolution. We present results for answering human issued search queries which
show considerable promise against basic versions of current generation question answering
systems.},
